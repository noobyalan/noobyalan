# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I’m Alan, your friendly neighborhood code slinger. If you’re looking for pristine, bug-free code, you might want to lower your expectations. 

## Skills:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, and a sprinkle of desperation.
- **Expertise**: Turning coffee into code (sometimes) and Googling errors like a pro.

## Fun Fact:
I once tried to build a time machine using nothing but duct tape and wishful thinking. Spoiler: It didn’t work. 

Feel free to browse my repositories, but don’t blame me if you find more memes than code!
