Hi there, I'm Alan ðŸ‘‹

I'm an International Business major with a growing passion for technology. While my academic background focuses on the world of business, I'm always exploring ways in which tech can drive innovation and improve business processes. I'm particularly interested in:

    Programming: Learning new languages and coding techniques.
    Artificial Intelligence: Understanding how AI can be applied in real-world scenarios.
    Business-Tech Integration: Finding ways to merge my business knowledge with emerging technologies.

ðŸŽ¶ Other Interests

When I'm not diving into tech or business strategies, you'll probably find me enjoying music. I'm a fan of:

    Classical music: Timeless compositions that inspire creativity.
    Rock music: The energy and passion that fuel my love for learning new things.

ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
